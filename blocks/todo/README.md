# My ToDo list #

Simple plugin implementing a personal ToDo list on the user's Moodle dashboard.

The main purpose of this plugin is to demonstrate usage of advanced coding techniques
available in recent Moodle versions. Most notably:

* Rendering HTML output via Mustache templates.
* AJAX based workflow of the elementary CRUD operations.
* Organising JS into AMD modules.
* Organising external functions into traits.
* Low-level access to the database via persistent models.
* Using exporters for handling the data structures in rendering and AJAX.
