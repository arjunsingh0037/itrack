 Optionally it will make group assignments for users. Another feature it
 has will allow you to make group assignments based on metacourse enrolls.


 INSTALLATION
 ------------
 Place the userenrols directory in the site's local directory. Access the
 notifications admin page to confirm installation. When viewing a course,
 the instructor will be able to access the plugin from the Course
 administration menu block under the 'Users' item.
